Redux:

A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state, in the form of an object.

A Container(smart component, as opposed to normal react dumb components) is a react component that has a direct connection to the redux state. React-Redux is what forms the bridge between the two libraries.

Only the most parent component that needs a connection to Redux for data needs to be a container. In the books example, Not App, not BookDetail, but BookList is the right one to make into a container. 

How to connect redux to react?
By setting the props of a react component to the redux state. 

ACTIONS:
action-creator returns an object, is triggered by a user event. 
action is just an object. 
that action is then set to all reducers, which passes through a switch statement to determine if the action is relevant. 

All reducers get two arguments, current state and action.

So now redux has taken over the application state, no tie to component state.

	A word imports the whole object from a library; what's wrapped in curly braces will pull off just a single property
